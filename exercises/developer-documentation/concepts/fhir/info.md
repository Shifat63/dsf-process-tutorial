## FHIR

The DSF uses a variety of [FHIR resources](https://dsf.dev/intro/info/basics.html#why-are-we-using-fhir-and-bpmn). They use the XML format for the DSF.  
The most important ones for plugin development will be [ActivityDefinitions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html), [Tasks](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html),
[CodeSystems](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem.html) and [ValueSets](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset.html).
There is also a catalogue of DSF-specific FHIR resources including CodeSystems, ValueSets and Extensions. For now, you can find them in the official
DSF GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/tree/main/dsf-fhir/dsf-fhir-validation/src/main/resources/fhir).
